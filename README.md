# DeFi Project

## Description

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that leverages smart contracts to provide financial services. The project consists of three main components:

- **Frontend (React)**: The user interface for interacting with the DeFi application.
- **Backend (Rust)**: The server-side component for handling requests and managing data.
- **Smart Contracts (Foundry)**: Smart contracts on Ethereum for executing financial transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Fetch
- **Backend**: Rust, Actix
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Foundry

## Installation

### Frontend

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install dependencies and build:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    cargo build
    ```

3. Run the server:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

### Smart Contracts

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd smart-contracts
    forge install
    ```

3. Compile and deploy smart contracts:

    ```bash
    forge build
    forge deploy
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the frontend application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Interact with the DeFi application through the provided UI.
